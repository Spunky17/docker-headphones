I know it says not to update this file manually but since I've forked this with the intention of updating it to make it usable again I figured what the hell.  :-)

Anyway, for those seeing this I'm just doing this as I regularly use this product and I find it useful and wanted the latest version of the Headphones application avaialble in a docker image again so I can deploy it to my TrueNAS server.

I simply kept the original file below so please DON'T believe anything below!

For now the only way to get the updated version is to clone this repository, do a docker build on the code and then create a custom yaml file to reference the new image.  I'm currently testing this on my TrueNAS system and have it working well with a few minor issues that need sorting out.
